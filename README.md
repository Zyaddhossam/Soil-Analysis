# Soil Analysis 🌱🖼️

This project features two AI models: one for classifying the type of soil, and another for determining whether the soil is suitable for planting.

## Description

This project aims to help farmers and support the agricultural industry through the use of two AI models. The first model classifies the type of soil based on a small image of the sample, while the second evaluates whether the identified soil is suitable for planting by analyzing the proportions of certain components, such as manganese.
This system can be especially useful for farmers, agronomists, and agricultural researchers looking to make informed, data-driven planting decisions.

## Features
- Predicts soil type from uploaded images
- Returns probabilities for each soil class
- Evaluates whether the identified soil is suitable for planting
- Suggests the most suitable types of plants for the given soil (future Work)

## Hosting Process
- We used **Microsoft Azure** to host the AI models used in the project.
- Launched a **Virtual Machine (VM)** that meets the requirements of our AI model.
- Installed the necessary dependencies and reserved the VM for one week to run the API, utilizing **ports 8000 and 5000**.
- Configured the **inbound port rules** in the Azure Portal to allow traffic through the specified ports.


### Model Details

#### 1. Soil Classification Model
- Input: Image of soil
- Output: Soil type
- Classes: Clay Soil, Alluvial Soil, Red Soil, Black Soil
- Description: This model analyzes a small image of the soil and classifies it into one of the predefined soil types. It is useful for quickly identifying soil type without manual testing.

#### 2. Soil Suitability Model
- Input: Numeric values for soil components (e.g., manganese, nitrogen)
- Output: Soil suitability For Planting
- Classes: Very Suitable, Suitable, Not Suitable
- Description: This model evaluates whether the soil is suitable for planting based on the proportions of key components. It helps determine the best use of the soil based on its nutrient composition.
